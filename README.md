## An Exercise in making R Shiny Apps:

This R Shiny called "Flower Iris Measurements". 

### Description

It specifically produces a plot and a table that enable the user to visualize the observations within this built-in data-set. The user may also tweak the plot and table through its various features.

### The Features
There are three main features of this app:
- FEATURE 1: Plot showing "Sepal.Width" that updates with user's choice of "Species"
- FEATURE 2: Table showing all five flower measurements that updates with user's choice of range for "Sepal.Length"
- ADDITIONAL FEATURES: The user may change between the frequency and density scale for the histogram. They may also sort the table in ascending order by "Sepal.Length" 
You can test out the app for yourself right [here]( https://liumt1573.shinyapps.io/app_main/)
