## A statement on GEN AI usage

### GEN AI prompts

For the purpose of this assessment, I have elected to not use generative AI. Instead, I have consulted the following resources:
- The STAT545 Course page on R Shiny and the BC liquor app found [here](https://ubc-stat.github.io/STAT545.github.io/webpages/lectures_ii/lec10_shiny.html)
- The POSIT website's own guide on creating R Shiny apps [here](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/shiny.html)
- [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11308367/error-in-my-code-object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable) StackExchange page on how to resolve issues with reactive variables
- The documentation of sundry functions detailed by the [RDocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/) website.

### A Reflection on AI Use

I chose not to use generative AI as I believe they have the propensity to provide incorrect information that are difficult to detect and correct. The AI may also use syntax and commands different from those introduced in class, making it difficulty to understand the output.
